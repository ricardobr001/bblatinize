# Latinize a string
This project is a simple latinize of strings

Sometimes you just want to create a branch from a history or a epic from bitbucket, and you need to rename it manually! :(  
So I've made this simple project that you just pass the string you want as an argument and you'll have the string copied to your clipboard! :D  

### How to use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardobr001/bblatinize
cd bblatinize

# Developed using node 12
# If you want, nvm use 12
node index.js "String You Want To Latiniz√©"
```
